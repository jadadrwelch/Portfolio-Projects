Python Calulator: Demonstrated input validation to prevent user errors. People need a quick and reliable way to perform basic math operations without using a physical calculator or online ads-filled tools.
Stack: Python. I would eventually like to add elements that would make the calculator more user friendly for scientific needs.

New York Webiste: Built and deployed a multi page site demonstrating front end fundamentals. Travelers and users needed a simple website to explore key information and cities in New York.
Stack: HTML5, CSS, Java. I would like to add more pages to alternate destinations.

Cost Calculator: Applied functions and logic to simulate real cost calculations. Users needed a tool to quickly estimate total costs based on miles per gallon and  dollars per gallon.
Stack: Python. I would like to add dynamic tax or currency conversion to this project.
